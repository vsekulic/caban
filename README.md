# CaBaN
### _Calcium analysis for Behaviour and Neurons_

CaBaN (かばん) is a "bag" of assorted routines (bag of tricks, perhaps) for Calcium imaging analysis. It can help answer the question: "OK, I now have ROIs and temporal activities for my cells, cross-registered across sessions. Now what?"

***NB**: Caban is currently not particularly user-friendly, it is largely tied to a particular project but has an object-oriented framework that allows expansion for other datasets. Factoring out user-definable variables to make it generally useful may be done at some point in the future.*
