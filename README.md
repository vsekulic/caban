# CaBaN
### _Calcium analysis with Behaviour and Neurons_

CaBaN is a "bag" (かばん) of assorted routines (bag of tricks, perhaps) for Calcium imaging analysis, designed for 1P Miniscope recordings, given the starting point of pre-existing outputs from [minian](https://minian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and behaviour camera positional data. It can help answer the question: "OK, I now have ROIs and temporal activities for my cells, cross-registered across sessions. *Now what*?"

***NB**: Caban is currently not particularly user-friendly, it is largely tied to a particular project but has an object-oriented framework that allows expansion for other datasets. Factoring out user-definable variables to make it generally useful may be done at some point in the future.*
